# 🔑 4. File Permissions & Ownership 

## 👥 1. Understanding Users, Groups, and Others
| Type   | Meaning                       |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| User   | The **owner** of the file     |
| Group  | A group the file belongs to   |
| Others | Everyone else on the system   |

## 🔍 2. File Permissions: r, w, x
| Permission | Symbol | What It Means                        |
|------------|--------|--------------------------------------|
| Read       | `r`    | Can **view** the file’s contents     |
| Write      | `w`    | Can **edit** or **delete** the file |
| Execute    | `x`    | Can **run** the file (if it’s a script or program) |

### ✅ Example Permission String:
-rwxr-xr--
Breakdown:
| Part  | Meaning                            |
| ----- | ---------------------------------- |
| `-`   | File type (`-` means regular file) |
| `rwx` | **User**: read, write, execute     |
| `r-x` | **Group**: read, execute           |
| `r--` | **Others**: read only              |

🔑 3. Viewing Permissions
ls -l file.txt

Example output:-  rw-r--r--  1 user group 1234 Jul 9 12:34 file.txt
rw- → user has read & write
r-- → group has read only
r-- → others have read only

🔧 4. Changing Permissions with chmod
🔹 Numeric (Octal) Way:
| Permission | Number |
| ---------- | ------ |
| `r`        | 4      |
| `w`        | 2      |
| `x`        | 1      |

Sum them up:
rwx → 4 + 2 + 1 = 7
rw- → 4 + 2 = 6
r-- → 4 = 4
🔑 Example Usage: 
chmod 755 file.sh
| User | Group | Others |
| ---- | ----- | ------ |
| 7    | 5     | 5      |
| rwx  | r-x   | r-x    |

🔹 Symbolic Way:
chmod u+x script.sh    # Add execute for user
chmod g-w file.txt     # Remove write from group
chmod o+r file.txt     # Add read for others


⚙️ 5. Default Permissions — umask

Every new file/folder has default permissions minus the umask value.
Check your default mask:  umask

Typical umask is 0022, meaning:
Users: full access
Group/Others: no write
You can temporarily change it: umask 0007
This would make new files accessible to user and group, but not others.

👑 6. Changing Ownership: chown & chgrp
🔹 chown — Change file owner
sudo chown newuser file.txt
➡ Change the file owner to newuser.

To change owner and group together:
sudo chown newuser:newgroup file.txt

🔹 chgrp — Change group
sudo chgrp devteam file.txt
➡ Change the group to devteam.
