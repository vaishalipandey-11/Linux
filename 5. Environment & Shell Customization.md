🌍 1. Environment Variables
✅ What are Environment Variables?
Environment variables are key-value pairs used by the shell and applications to configure your environment.

Example:
echo $HOME
This prints your home directory.

🔑 Common Environment Variables
| Variable | Purpose                            |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `$HOME`  | Path to your home directory        |
| `$USER`  | Current logged-in username         |
| `$PATH`  | Directories to search for commands |
| `$SHELL` | The default shell you're using     |
| `$PWD`   | Current directory                  |

🔧 Setting Environment Variables (Temporary):

export VAR_NAME="value"

Example:
export MYNAME="vp"
echo $MYNAME
➡️ This will only last until you close the terminal.

🔧 Make Variables Permanent:

1.Open .bashrc (or .profile):
nano ~/.bashrc

2.Add this at the end:
export MYNAME="vp"

3.Save & exit.
4.Reload the file:
source ~/.bashrc

🛡️ 2. Aliases
✅ What is an Alias?
An alias is a shortcut for a command or set of commands.

Example:
alias ll='ls -la'
Now, typing ll runs ls -la.

🔧 Create Temporary Alias:
alias gs='git status'
➡ Works only for the current session.

🔧 Make Aliases Permanent:
1.Open .bashrc:
nano ~/.bashrc

2.Add:
alias ll='ls -la'
alias gs='git status'

3.Reload:
source ~/.bashrc

❌ Remove an Alias:
unalias ll

🔍 3. Command History

✅ View Command History:
history
➡ Shows your last used commands.

🔎 Reverse Search in History:

While in terminal, press:
Ctrl + R
➡ Type part of a command → it searches backward in history.

Example:
(reverse-i-search)`ssh': ssh myserver

| Command | Purpose                                     |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `!!`    | Re-run the **last command**                 |
| `!n`    | Run command number **n** from history       |
| `!grep` | Run the **last command starting with grep** |

🔧 Customize the History Behavior:
HISTSIZE=1000    # Number of commands stored in session
HISTFILESIZE=2000 # Number of commands stored in .bash_history


🎨 4. Shell Prompt Customization (PS1)
✅ What is PS1?
PS1 defines how your command prompt looks.

Default:
vp@ubuntu:~/Documents$

🔧 Change it Temporarily:

PS1=">>> "
➡ Now your prompt looks like:
>>> 


🔧 Set Permanent Custom Prompt:

1.Open .bashrc:
 nano ~/.bashrc

2.Add your new prompt:
 export PS1="\u@\h:\w\$ "

\u = username
\h = hostname
\w = current directory

3.Reload:
 source ~/.bashrc

🔹 Example Custom Prompt:
export PS1="[\u at \h in \w] $ "

➡ Looks like:
[vp at ubuntu in ~/Documents] $
