## üìä Viewing Network Information

### Check IP Address and Interface Status

#### Understanding Network Interfaces
Network interfaces are your computer's network connections:
- **eth0, ens33**: Ethernet (wired) connections
- **wlan0, wlp2s0**: WiFi connections  
- **lo**: Loopback (localhost - 127.0.0.1)

#### Method 1: `ip` Command (Modern & Recommended)

**Show all interfaces with IP addresses:**
```bash
ip addr show
# Short form
ip a
```

**Sample output explained:**
```bash
2: wlp2s0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP
    link/ether a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2e brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.1.105/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic noprefixoption wlp2s0
       valid_lft 86313sec preferred_lft 86313sec
```

**What this means:**
- `wlp2s0`: Interface name (WiFi card)
- `UP`: Interface is active
- `192.168.1.105/24`: Your IP address with subnet mask
- `a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2e`: MAC address (hardware identifier)

**Show specific interface:**
```bash
ip addr show wlp2s0
```

**Show only IPv4 addresses:**
```bash
ip -4 addr show
```

**Show interface statistics:**
```bash
ip -s link show
```

#### Method 2: Quick IP Checks
```bash
# Get your main IP address
hostname -I

# Get all IPs in simple format  
ip route get 1.1.1.1 | awk '{print $7}'

# Check if interface is up
ip link show wlp2s0 | grep -q "state UP" && echo "UP" || echo "DOWN"
```

#### Method 3: Legacy `ifconfig` (if installed)
```bash
# Install if needed
sudo apt install net-tools

# Show all interfaces
ifconfig

# Show specific interface
ifconfig wlp2s0
```

### View Routing Table

#### Understanding Routing
The routing table tells your computer where to send network traffic:
- **Default route**: Where to send internet traffic (usually your router)
- **Local routes**: How to reach devices on your network
- **Specific routes**: Custom paths for certain destinations

#### View Routes with `ip route`
```bash
# Show all routes
ip route show
# Short form
ip r
```

**Sample output:**
```bash
default via 192.168.1.1 dev wlp2s0 proto dhcp metric 600 
192.168.1.0/24 dev wlp2s0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.1.105 metric 600
```

**Understanding the output:**
- `default via 192.168.1.1`: All internet traffic goes through 192.168.1.1 (your router)
- `dev wlp2s0`: Using interface wlp2s0
- `192.168.1.0/24`: Local network range
- `src 192.168.1.105`: Your computer's IP address

**Useful routing commands:**
```bash
# Show only default route (gateway)
ip route | grep default

# Show routes for specific destination
ip route get 8.8.8.8

# Show routing table with details
ip route show table all
```

#### Legacy `route` command
```bash
# Show routing table
route -n

# Show routing table with hostnames resolved
route
```

### View DNS Configuration

#### Understanding DNS
DNS (Domain Name System) translates website names (google.com) to IP addresses (172.217.164.110).

#### Method 1: `systemd-resolve` (Ubuntu 18.04+)
```bash
# Show detailed DNS information
systemd-resolve --status

# Show DNS servers only
systemd-resolve --status | grep "DNS Servers"

# Show per-interface DNS settings
resolvectl status
```

**Sample output:**
```bash
Global:
       LLMNR setting: no                  
MulticastDNS setting: no                  
  DNSOverTLS setting: no                  
      DNSSEC setting: no                  
    DNSSEC supported: no                  
          DNS Servers: 192.168.1.1
                       8.8.8.8
```

#### Method 2: Check resolver configuration
```bash
# View current DNS servers
cat /etc/resolv.conf

# Check if it's managed by systemd
ls -la /etc/resolv.conf
```

#### Method 3: NetworkManager DNS info
```bash
nmcli dev show | grep DNS
```

## üîß Testing Network Connectivity

### Ping and Traceroute

#### Ping - Basic Connectivity Test
**Ping** sends small packets to test if a destination is reachable and measure response time.

**Basic ping usage:**
```bash
# Ping a website (Press Ctrl+C to stop)
ping google.com

# Ping with specific count
ping -c 4 google.com

# Ping your gateway/router
ping 192.168.1.1

# Ping localhost
ping 127.0.0.1
```

**Understanding ping output:**
```bash
PING google.com (142.250.191.14) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from lga25s62-in-f14.1e100.net (142.250.191.14): icmp_seq=1 time=23.2 ms
64 bytes from lga25s62-in-f14.1e100.net (142.250.191.14): icmp_seq=2 time=22.8 ms
```

**What this tells you:**
- `time=23.2 ms`: Response time (latency)
- Lower times = faster connection
- Lost packets = connectivity issues

**Advanced ping options:**
```bash
# Ping with larger packets
ping -s 1000 google.com

# Ping with interval (wait 2 seconds between pings)
ping -i 2 google.com

# Flood ping (requires sudo, use carefully)
sudo ping -f google.com

# IPv6 ping
ping6 google.com
```

#### Traceroute - Show Network Path
**Traceroute** shows every router/hop your packets travel through to reach the destination.

```bash
# Trace route to destination
traceroute google.com

# Trace route with IP addresses only (faster)
traceroute -n google.com

# Use ICMP instead of UDP
traceroute -I google.com
```

**Understanding traceroute output:**
```bash
 1  192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1)  2.123 ms  1.876 ms  1.654 ms
 2  10.0.0.1 (10.0.0.1)  12.345 ms  11.234 ms  13.456 ms
 3  * * *
 4  172.16.0.1 (172.16.0.1)  25.789 ms  24.567 ms  26.123 ms
```

**What this means:**
- Each line is a router in the path
- Three time measurements show consistency
- `* * *` means that hop doesn't respond (common, not necessarily a problem)

#### Alternative: `mtr` (My Traceroute)
```bash
# Install mtr
sudo apt install mtr

# Continuous traceroute with statistics
mtr google.com

# Run 10 cycles and exit
mtr -c 10 google.com
```

### DNS Testing (dig or nslookup)

#### Using `dig` (Domain Information Groper) - Preferred Tool

**Basic DNS lookup:**
```bash
# Look up IP address for domain
dig google.com

# Get just the answer (IP address)
dig +short google.com

# Reverse DNS lookup (IP to domain)
dig -x 8.8.8.8
```

**Different DNS record types:**
```bash
# A record (IPv4 address)
dig google.com A

# AAAA record (IPv6 address) 
dig google.com AAAA

# MX record (mail servers)
dig google.com MX

# NS record (name servers)
dig google.com NS

# TXT record (text information)
dig google.com TXT

# All records
dig google.com ANY
```

**Using specific DNS servers:**
```bash
# Query Google's DNS server
dig @8.8.8.8 google.com

# Query Cloudflare's DNS server
dig @1.1.1.1 google.com

# Query your local DNS server
dig @192.168.1.1 google.com
```

**Advanced dig usage:**
```bash
# Trace DNS query path
dig +trace google.com

# Get detailed output
dig +noall +answer google.com

# Query with TCP instead of UDP
dig +tcp google.com
```

#### Using `nslookup` (Simpler but less detailed)

```bash
# Basic lookup
nslookup google.com

# Interactive mode
nslookup
> google.com
> exit

# Use specific DNS server
nslookup google.com 8.8.8.8

# Reverse lookup
nslookup 8.8.8.8

# Query specific record type
nslookup -type=MX google.com
```

### Check Open Ports and Listening Services

#### Using `ss` (Socket Statistics) - Modern Tool

**Show all listening ports:**
```bash
# All listening TCP and UDP ports
ss -tuln

# With process information (requires sudo)
sudo ss -tulpn

# Only TCP listening ports
ss -tln

# Only UDP listening ports  
ss -uln
```

**Understanding `ss` output:**
```bash
State    Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address:Port    Peer Address:Port Process
LISTEN   0      128     0.0.0.0:22           0.0.0.0:*     users:(("sshd",pid=1234,fd=3))
```

**What this means:**
- `LISTEN`: Service is waiting for connections
- `0.0.0.0:22`: Listening on all interfaces, port 22 (SSH)
- `sshd`: SSH daemon is the process

**Filter by port or service:**
```bash
# Show specific port
ss -tuln | grep :22

# Show established connections
ss -tun state established

# Show connections to specific IP
ss -tun dst 192.168.1.100
```

#### Using `netstat` (Legacy but still useful)

```bash
# Install if needed
sudo apt install net-tools

# Show listening ports
netstat -tuln

# Show with process names
sudo netstat -tulpn

# Show active connections
netstat -at

# Show network statistics
netstat -s
```

#### Test Remote Ports

**Using `nc` (netcat):**
```bash
# Test if port is open
nc -zv google.com 80
nc -zv google.com 443

# Scan range of ports
nc -zv google.com 80-85

# Connect to service (interactive)
nc google.com 80
```

**Using `telnet`:**
```bash
# Test HTTP port
telnet google.com 80

# Test HTTPS port  
telnet google.com 443

# Exit: Ctrl+] then type 'quit'
```

**Using `nmap` (Network Mapper):**
```bash
# Install nmap
sudo apt install nmap

# Scan common ports
nmap google.com

# Scan specific ports
nmap -p 22,80,443 google.com

# Scan port range
nmap -p 1-1000 google.com

# Fast scan
nmap -F google.com
```

### Configure Static or Dynamic IP (Basic Netplan)

#### Understanding IP Configuration Types

**Dynamic IP (DHCP):**
- Router automatically assigns IP address
- Most common for home users
- IP address may change

**Static IP:**
- Manually set fixed IP address  
- Useful for servers, printers
- IP address never changes

#### Using Netplan (Ubuntu 18.04+)

**Find netplan configuration files:**
```bash
ls /etc/netplan/
# Common files:
# 01-network-manager-all.yaml
# 50-cloud-init.yaml
```

**Check current configuration:**
```bash
cat /etc/netplan/*.yaml
```

#### Configure Dynamic IP (DHCP)

**Create/edit netplan file:**
```bash
sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml
```

**For WiFi with DHCP:**
```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: NetworkManager
  wifis:
    wlp2s0:
      dhcp4: yes
      access-points:
        "YourWiFiName":
          password: "YourPassword"
```

**For Ethernet with DHCP:**
```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    eth0:
      dhcp4: yes
      dhcp6: no
```

#### Configure Static IP

**Static IP configuration:**
```bash
sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml
```

**For Ethernet with static IP:**
```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    eth0:
      dhcp4: no
      addresses:
        - 192.168.1.100/24
      gateway4: 192.168.1.1
      nameservers:
        addresses: [8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4]
        search: [local]
```

**For WiFi with static IP:**
```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: NetworkManager  
  wifis:
    wlp2s0:
      dhcp4: no
      addresses:
        - 192.168.1.150/24
      gateway4: 192.168.1.1
      nameservers:
        addresses: [8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1]
      access-points:
        "YourWiFiName":
          password: "YourPassword"
```

**Understanding the configuration:**
- `addresses: [192.168.1.100/24]`: Your static IP with subnet mask
- `gateway4: 192.168.1.1`: Your router's IP (usually .1)
- `nameservers`: DNS servers to use
- `/24` means subnet mask 255.255.255.0

#### Apply Netplan Configuration

```bash
# Test configuration (will auto-revert if problems)
sudo netplan try

# Apply configuration permanently
sudo netplan apply

# Generate and apply
sudo netplan generate
sudo netplan apply
```

**Debug netplan issues:**
```bash
# Check configuration syntax
sudo netplan --debug apply

# View generated configuration
cat /run/systemd/network/*
```

## üîó Remote Access and File Transfer

### SSH (Remote Login)

#### Understanding SSH
SSH (Secure Shell) lets you securely log into and control remote computers over the network. It encrypts all communication.

#### Basic SSH Usage

**Connect to remote server:**
```bash
# Basic connection
ssh username@server_ip
# Example:
ssh john@192.168.1.50

# Connect to specific port (if SSH runs on non-standard port)
ssh -p 2222 username@server_ip

# Connect with verbose output (helpful for troubleshooting)
ssh -v username@server_ip
```

**First connection:**
```bash
# You'll see something like:
The authenticity of host '192.168.1.50 (192.168.1.50)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:abc123def456...
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
```
Type `yes` to accept and save the host key.

#### SSH Key Authentication (More Secure Than Passwords)

**Generate SSH key pair:**
```bash
# Generate RSA key (recommended)
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Generate Ed25519 key (newer, more secure)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Follow prompts:
# - Accept default location (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa)
# - Enter passphrase for extra security (optional)
```

**Copy public key to remote server:**
```bash
# Automatic method (easiest)
ssh-copy-id username@server_ip

# Manual method
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh username@server_ip "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

**Test key-based login:**
```bash
ssh username@server_ip
# Should login without password prompt
```

#### SSH Configuration File

**Create/edit SSH client config:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
nano ~/.ssh/config
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
```

**Example configuration:**
```bash
# Home server
Host homeserver
    HostName 192.168.1.50
    User john
    Port 22
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# Work server with non-standard port
Host workserver
    HostName work.example.com
    User jsmith
    Port 2222
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/work_key

# Server that requires specific settings
Host oldserver
    HostName 10.0.0.100
    User admin
    KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
```

**Now you can connect with:**
```bash
ssh homeserver
ssh workserver  
ssh oldserver
```

#### Useful SSH Commands

```bash
# Run single command on remote server
ssh user@server "ls -la"

# Run multiple commands
ssh user@server "cd /var/log && tail -n 10 syslog"

# Forward local port to remote server (SSH tunnel)
ssh -L 8080:localhost:80 user@server

# Forward remote port to local machine
ssh -R 9090:localhost:3000 user@server

# Keep connection alive with X11 forwarding
ssh -X user@server

# Execute local script on remote server
ssh user@server 'bash -s' < local_script.sh
```

### SCP (Secure Copy)

#### Understanding SCP
SCP uses SSH to securely copy files between computers. It works like `cp` command but over the network.

#### Copy Files TO Remote Server

```bash
# Copy single file to remote home directory
scp file.txt username@server_ip:

# Copy file to specific remote directory
scp file.txt username@server_ip:/path/to/destination/

# Copy file with new name
scp file.txt username@server_ip:/path/to/destination/newname.txt

# Copy directory recursively
scp -r my_folder/ username@server_ip:/remote/path/

# Copy multiple files
scp file1.txt file2.txt username@server_ip:/remote/path/
```

#### Copy Files FROM Remote Server

```bash
# Copy file from remote to current local directory
scp username@server_ip:/remote/path/file.txt .

# Copy file to specific local directory
scp username@server_ip:/remote/path/file.txt /local/path/

# Copy directory from remote
scp -r username@server_ip:/remote/folder/ ./local_folder/

# Copy with original timestamps preserved
scp -p username@server_ip:/remote/file.txt .
```

#### Advanced SCP Usage

```bash
# Use specific SSH port
scp -P 2222 file.txt username@server_ip:/path/

# Use specific SSH key
scp -i ~/.ssh/special_key file.txt username@server_ip:/path/

# Show progress and verbose output
scp -v file.txt username@server_ip:/path/

# Copy between two remote servers (through your computer)
scp user1@server1:/path/file.txt user2@server2:/path/

# Use SSH config aliases
scp file.txt homeserver:/path/
```

#### Alternative: SFTP (Interactive File Transfer)

```bash
# Start SFTP session
sftp username@server_ip

# SFTP commands (similar to FTP):
ls                    # list remote files
lls                   # list local files
pwd                   # show remote directory  
lpwd                  # show local directory
cd /remote/directory  # change remote directory
lcd /local/directory  # change local directory
get filename          # download file
put filename          # upload file
get -r foldername     # download folder recursively
put -r foldername     # upload folder recursively  
mkdir dirname         # create remote directory
lmkdir dirname        # create local directory
rm filename           # delete remote file
lrm filename          # delete local file
exit                  # quit SFTP
```

### curl/wget (Download Files)

#### Using `wget` (Web Get)

**Basic file download:**
```bash
# Download file to current directory
wget https://example.com/file.zip

# Download with different filename
wget -O myfile.zip https://example.com/file.zip

```bash
# View NetworkManager logs
journalctl -u NetworkManager

# View recent NetworkManager logs
journalctl -u NetworkManager --since "5 minutes ago"

# Follow NetworkManager logs in real-time
journalctl -u NetworkManager -f

# Restart networking stack completely
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
```

### Basic systemctl Commands for Network Services

#### Understanding systemctl
`systemctl` is the command to control systemd services. Most network-related services are managed by systemd.

#### Common Network Services

```bash
# List all network-related services
systemctl list-units --type=service | grep -i network

# Show status of important network services
sudo systemctl status NetworkManager
sudo systemctl status systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl status systemd-networkd
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

#### Managing Individual Network Services

**DNS Resolution Service:**
```bash
# Restart DNS resolver
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved

# Check DNS resolver status
sudo systemctl status systemd-resolved

# View DNS resolver logs
journalctl -u systemd-resolved
```

**SSH Service:**
```bash
# Start SSH service
sudo systemctl start ssh

# Enable SSH to start at boot
sudo systemctl enable ssh

# Restart SSH service
sudo systemctl restart ssh

# Check SSH status
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

**Network Configuration Service:**
```bash
# For systems using systemd-networkd instead of NetworkManager
sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd
sudo systemctl status systemd-networkd
```

#### Service Control Commands

```bash
# Start a service
sudo systemctl start service_name

# Stop a service  
sudo systemctl stop service_name

# Restart a service
sudo systemctl restart service_name

# Reload service configuration without full restart
sudo systemctl reload service_name

# Enable service to start at boot
sudo systemctl enable service_name

# Disable service from starting at boot
sudo systemctl disable service_name

# Check if service is running
systemctl is-active service_name

# Check if service is enabled
systemctl is-enabled service_name

# Show detailed service status
systemctl status service_name
```

#### Network Service Logs

```bash
# View all system logs
journalctl

# View logs for specific service
journalctl -u NetworkManager
journalctl -u systemd-resolved
journalctl -u ssh

# View recent logs (last hour)
journalctl --since "1 hour ago"

# Follow logs in real-time
journalctl -f

# View logs with specific priority (error, warning, etc.)
journalctl -p err
```

#### Emergency Network Reset

When networking is completely broken:
```bash
# Method 1: Restart all network services
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd

# Method 2: Reset network interfaces
sudo ip link set wlp2s0 down
sudo ip link set wlp2s0 up

# Method 3: Flush and renew IP
sudo ip addr flush dev wlp2s0
sudo dhclient wlp2s0

# Method 4: Complete network restart (last resort)
sudo systemctl restart networking
```

## üìÅ Important Files to Know

### `/etc/resolv.conf` - DNS Configuration

#### Understanding resolv.conf
This file tells your system which DNS servers to use for domain name resolution.

```bash
# View current DNS configuration
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

**Typical content:**
```bash
# This file is managed by man:systemd-resolved(8). Do not edit.
nameserver 127.0.0.53
options edns0 trust-ad
search localdomain
```

**Understanding the entries:**
- `nameserver`: DNS server IP addresses
- `search`: Default domain suffixes to try
- `options`: DNS resolver options

#### Types of resolv.conf Management

**1. Systemd-resolved (Ubuntu 18.04+):**
```bash
# Check if systemd-resolved is managing DNS
ls -la /etc/resolv.conf
# If it points to /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf, it's managed by systemd

# View actual DNS servers
systemd-resolve --status
```

**2. NetworkManager managed:**
```bash
# NetworkManager updates this file automatically
# Don't edit directly - use NetworkManager tools instead
```

**3. Static configuration:**
```bash
# If you need to manually configure DNS
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf

# Example static configuration:
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
nameserver 192.168.1.1
