# 🌍 1. Environment Variables

## ✅ What Are Environment Variables?

Environment variables are **key-value pairs** used by the shell and applications to configure your environment.

Example:

```bash
echo $HOME
```

➡️ Prints your home directory.

## 🔑 Common Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose                            |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `$HOME`  | Path to your home directory        |
| `$USER`  | Current logged-in username         |
| `$PATH`  | Directories to search for commands |
| `$SHELL` | The default shell you're using     |
| `$PWD`   | Current working directory          |

## 🔧 Setting Environment Variables (Temporary)

```bash
export VAR_NAME="value"
```

Example:

```bash
export MYNAME="vp"
echo $MYNAME
```

➡️ This variable exists only in the current terminal session.

## 🔧 Make Variables Permanent

1. Open `.bashrc`:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```
2. Add this line at the end:

   ```bash
   export MYNAME="vp"
   ```
3. Save & exit.
4. Reload the file:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

# 🛡️ 2. Aliases

## ✅ What Is an Alias?

An alias is a **shortcut for a command or set of commands**.

Example:

```bash
alias ll='ls -la'
```

Now, typing `ll` runs `ls -la`.

## 🔧 Create Temporary Alias

```bash
alias gs='git status'
```

➡️ Works only for the current session.

## 🔧 Make Aliases Permanent

1. Open `.bashrc`:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```
2. Add your aliases:

   ```bash
   alias ll='ls -la'
   alias gs='git status'
   ```
3. Reload the file:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

## ❌ Remove an Alias

```bash
unalias ll
```

---

# 🔍 3. Command History

## ✅ View Command History

```bash
history
```

➡️ Shows your last used commands.

## 🔎 Reverse Search in History

Press **Ctrl + R** in the terminal.
➡️ Start typing part of a command, it will search backwards through your history.

Example:

```
(reverse-i-search)`ssh': ssh myserver
```

## ⏪ Useful History Shortcuts

| Command | Purpose                                     |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `!!`    | Run the **last command**                    |
| `!n`    | Run command number **n** from history       |
| `!grep` | Run the **last command starting with grep** |

## 🔧 Customize History Behavior

Add this in `.bashrc` to control history size:

```bash
HISTSIZE=1000      # Number of commands stored in session
HISTFILESIZE=2000  # Number of commands saved in the .bash_history file
```

---

# 🎨 4. Shell Prompt Customization (PS1)

## ✅ What is PS1?

`PS1` defines how your **command prompt** looks.

Example default:

```
vp@ubuntu:~/Documents$
```

## 🔧 Change Prompt Temporarily

```bash
PS1=">>> "
```

➡️ Now your prompt looks like:

```
>>>
```

## 🔧 Set Permanent Custom Prompt

1. Open `.bashrc`:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. Add your new prompt:

   ```bash
   export PS1="\u@\h:\w\$ "
   ```

   * `\u` = username
   * `\h` = hostname
   * `\w` = current directory

3. Reload:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

## 🔹 Example Custom Prompt

```bash
export PS1="[\u at \h in \w] $ "
```

➡️ Looks like:

```
[vp at ubuntu in ~/Documents] $
```
