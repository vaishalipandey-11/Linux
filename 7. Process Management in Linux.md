# üõ†Ô∏è 7. Process Management in Linux

## ‚úÖ What is a Process?

A **process** is a **running instance of a program**. Every command you run on Linux (e.g., `ls`, `nano`, `firefox`, etc.) creates a process.

Each process has a **unique Process ID (PID)** and belongs to a **user**.

---

## üîç Viewing Processes

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è `ps` - Process Snapshot

* Shows a **snapshot** of currently running processes.

```bash
ps          # Shows processes in current shell
ps aux      # Shows all processes in detail
ps -ef      # Another popular format (standardized)
```

| Option | Meaning                            |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `a`    | Show all users' processes          |
| `u`    | Show the user/owner of the process |
| `x`    | Show processes without terminal    |
| `-e`   | Show every process                 |
| `-f`   | Show full format                   |

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è `top` - Real-time Process Monitor

* Like **Task Manager** in Windows.
* Refreshes every few seconds.

```bash
top
```

‚ùó Press `q` to quit, `k` to kill a process, `h` for help inside top.

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è `htop` - Advanced Process Monitor

* More user-friendly version of `top`.
* Use arrow keys, colors, and mouse.

```bash
sudo apt install htop   # Install on Ubuntu
htop
```

‚úÖ You can easily search, kill processes, and view CPU/Memory usage visually.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Managing Processes

### üî® `kill` - Kill a Process by PID

```bash
kill <PID>             # Gracefully terminate
kill -9 <PID>          # Forcefully terminate (SIGKILL)
```

Example:

```bash
kill 1234
```

---

### üî® `killall` - Kill by Process Name

```bash
killall firefox        # Kill all firefox processes
```

---

### üî® `pkill` - Pattern Match Kill

```bash
pkill firefox          # Same as killall
pkill -f some_script   # Kill processes by full command line match
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Background & Foreground Jobs (for Terminal Jobs)

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è `jobs` - List Background Jobs in Shell

```bash
jobs
```

Shows background processes started in this terminal.

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è `bg` - Run Suspended Job in Background

```bash
bg %1
```

* `%1`: Job number from `jobs` output.

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è `fg` - Bring Background Job to Foreground

```bash
fg %1
```

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Process Priorities

Linux uses **nice values** to determine process priority.

| Value | Priority Level   |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| -20   | Highest priority |
| 0     | Default priority |
| 19    | Lowest priority  |

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è `nice` - Start Process with Priority

Run a new process with lower priority (be nice to other processes):

```bash
nice -n 10 command
```

Example:

```bash
nice -n 15 cp largefile /tmp
```

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è `renice` - Change Priority of Existing Process

```bash
renice -n 5 -p <PID>
```

Example:

```bash
renice -n -5 -p 1234   # Increase priority
```

---

## üìë Important Signals in kill Command

| Signal | Description                             |
| ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `1`    | SIGHUP: Reload configuration            |
| `9`    | SIGKILL: Force kill (ungraceful)        |
| `15`   | SIGTERM: Graceful termination (default) |

Example:

```bash
kill -15 1234  # Default way to ask a process to exit
```

---

## üß† Master Tips

* Always try **SIGTERM (15)** before **SIGKILL (9)**.
* Use `htop` for **easy interactive process management**.
* Background processes are managed **per terminal**, not system-wide.
* System processes (like `systemd`, `cron`, etc.) run with **root privileges**, so you may need `sudo`.
