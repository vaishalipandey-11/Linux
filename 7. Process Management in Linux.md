# 🧠 Linux Process Management

Master every concept, command, and trick related to **processes** in Linux.

## 📌 Introduction

In Linux, **everything is a process**, whether it's your text editor, terminal, or a background system service.

## 📚 Understanding Processes

* **Process**: A running instance of a program.
* Every process has:

  * **PID** (Process ID)
  * **PPID** (Parent PID)
  * **UID** (User ID who owns the process)

---
## 🔍 Types of Processes

* **Foreground**: Attached to terminal (e.g., `vim file.txt`)
* **Background**: Runs detached using `&` (e.g., `sleep 100 &`)
* **Interactive**: Waits for user input
* **Batch**: Scheduled without user interaction
* **Daemon**: Background process, often system-level (e.g., `sshd`)

## 🔬 Viewing Processes

| Command           | Description                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `ps`              | Show snapshot of current processes            |
| `ps aux`          | Show all users' processes                     |
| `top`             | Dynamic real-time process viewer              |
| `htop`            | Improved `top`, needs `sudo apt install htop` |
| `pgrep <name>`    | Find PID of a running process                 |
| `pidof <command>` | Get PID of a process by name                  |
| `jobs`            | Show current user’s background jobs           |
| `pstree`          | Display process tree                          |

```bash
ps aux | grep firefox
pgrep -l bash
pstree -p
```

## 📈 Process States

| State | Description           |
| ----- | --------------------- |
| R     | Running               |
| S     | Sleeping (idle)       |
| D     | Uninterruptible sleep |
| Z     | Zombie                |
| T     | Stopped (job control) |
| X     | Dead                  |

Use `ps -eo pid,stat,cmd` to see process states.

---

## 🚦 Foreground & Background Jobs

* **Run in background**:

  ```bash
  command &
  ```
* **View jobs**:

  ```bash
  jobs
  ```
* **Bring to foreground**:

  ```bash
  fg %<job_id>
  ```
* **Stop (pause) job**:
  Press `Ctrl+Z`
* **Move to background**:

  ```bash
  bg %<job_id>
  ```

## 🔫 Signals & Killing Processes

| Command           | Use                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| `kill PID`        | Send SIGTERM (default)   |
| `kill -9 PID`     | Force kill (SIGKILL)     |
| `killall <name>`  | Kill by name             |
| `pkill <pattern>` | Kill by regex or pattern |
| `xkill`           | Click to kill GUI app    |
| `trap`            | Catch signals in scripts |

```bash
kill -15 1234   # Graceful stop
kill -9 1234    # Immediate kill
killall firefox
```

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Controlling

### 1. `top` / `htop`

* Show CPU/memory usage
* Kill process by `k` in `top`
* Press `P` to sort by CPU

### 2. `watch`

```bash
watch -n 2 ps aux | grep apache
```

### 3. `strace`

```bash
strace -p <pid>
```

Trace system calls of a process.

### 4. `lsof` (List open files)

```bash
lsof -p <pid>
```

---

## 🎚 Nice & Renice – Priorities

* **Nice value range**: `-20` (highest) to `19` (lowest)

```bash
nice -n 10 command        # Start process with priority
renice -n -5 -p <pid>     # Change priority of running process
```

Only `root` can set higher priority (`negative nice`).

---

## 🧟 Orphan & Zombie Processes

### Orphan:

* Parent dies, but child lives.
* Adopted by `init` (`PID 1`).

### Zombie:

* Process completed but not cleaned up.
* Can be seen using `ps aux | grep Z`.

To clean:

* Kill parent.
* Or restart service.

---

## 🌳 Process Trees & Parent-Child

```bash
pstree
ps -ef --forest
```

* Understand which process started what.
* Useful for debugging daemons and child threads.

---

## 🛠 Startup & Daemons

### Systemd (Ubuntu 16.04+):

```bash
systemctl status
systemctl start apache2
systemctl stop apache2
systemctl enable nginx
```

### `cron` jobs:

* Scheduled background tasks

```bash
crontab -e
```

## 🧰 Useful Tools Summary

| Tool                       | Use                        |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `ps`, `top`, `htop`        | List and monitor processes |
| `nice`, `renice`           | Control priority           |
| `kill`, `pkill`, `killall` | Manage processes           |
| `pstree`, `strace`, `lsof` | Inspect process info       |
| `jobs`, `fg`, `bg`         | Job control                |
| `systemctl`, `cron`        | Manage background daemons  |

---

## 🎁 Bonus Tips

### ⏱ Time a command

```bash
time ls -lR /
```

### 📌 Create long-running dummy process

```bash
yes > /dev/null &
```

### 🚧 Prevent accidental closure (nohup)

```bash
nohup myscript.sh &
disown
```

### 📜 View process environment

```bash
cat /proc/<pid>/environ
```

### 🧪 Check memory usage by PID

```bash
cat /proc/<pid>/status
```
