🐧 1. Linux Distributions & Shells
🔹 What is Linux?
Linux is an open-source UNIX-like operating system kernel.

A Linux Distribution (Distro) = Linux Kernel + Software Tools + Package Managers + GUI (optional).

🔹 Popular Linux Distributions
| Category          | Examples                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Beginner-Friendly | Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Fedora      |
| Lightweight       | Arch Linux, Alpine, Puppy Linux |
| Enterprise        | Red Hat, SUSE Linux, CentOS     |
| Server-Focused    | Debian, Ubuntu Server, CentOS   |

🔹 What is a Shell?
A shell is a command interpreter that lets you interact with the OS.

🔹 Popular Shells
| Shell | Command | Key Feature                       |
| ----- | ------- | --------------------------------- |
| Bash  | `bash`  | Default on most distros           |
| Zsh   | `zsh`   | Richer auto-completion            |
| Fish  | `fish`  | Friendly syntax                   |
| Ksh   | `ksh`   | KornShell, used in legacy systems |

➡️ Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is the most widely used.

🖥️ 2. Terminal vs Shell vs Console
| Term                  | Meaning                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Terminal Emulator** | A software that **displays** the shell (e.g., GNOME Terminal, Konsole).                           |
| **Shell**             | The **program that runs the commands** (bash, zsh, fish).                                         |
| **Console**           | Originally the **physical terminal**, today refers to TTY or virtual console (Ctrl+Alt+F1 \~ F6). |

Keyboard/Screen  -> Terminal Emulator  -> Shell  -> Linux Kernel
