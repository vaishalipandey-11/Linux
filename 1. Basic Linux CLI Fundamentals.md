‚û°Ô∏è Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is the most widely used.

üñ•Ô∏è 2. Terminal vs Shell vs Console
| Term                  | Meaning                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Terminal Emulator** | A software that **displays** the shell (e.g., GNOME Terminal, Konsole).                           |
| **Shell**             | The **program that runs the commands** (bash, zsh, fish).                                         |
| **Console**           | Originally the **physical terminal**, today refers to TTY or virtual console (Ctrl+Alt+F1 \~ F6). |

Keyboard/Screen  -> Terminal Emulator  -> Shell  -> Linux Kernel
